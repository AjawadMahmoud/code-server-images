# code-server-images

This repo contains set of Docker files that can be used to build different images for `Coder` [`code-server`](https://github.com/cdr/code-server), the [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) on a remote server solution.

The repo was inspired by an attempt to create a `code-server` image for Python development, and with it I decided to create multiple images for different purposes.

Feel free to fork this repo to create your custom image based on any of the images available in it. You can also contribute to this repo by sending a PR containing your image `Dockerfile`.
